# Processed Data

## Brief Introduction
The folder consists of a couple of Python scripts which assist in creating our cleaned data to process through the LSTM model.

The folder is organized and used in the following:

`create_sepsis_label.py` -  A Python script which takes in a processed data and output if a patient would be called for code sepsis based on UC San Diego Health protocol.

`create_feature_labels.py` - 

`imputed_data.csv` - Processed csv files containing data that has been imputed with the mean of each vital sign. Will be updated!

`Data Cleaning.ipynb` - Python notebook highlighting outliers in data or how to fill in some missing values. Will need to use this to achieve a better, more cleaned DataFrame.

`Archive.zip` - 

`create_future_labels.ipynb` -
